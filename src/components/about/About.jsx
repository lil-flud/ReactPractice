      <h2>Software Developer</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Logan Floyd and I am a student at Base Camp Coding
            Academy's Graduate Institute. My plan is to leave BCCA GI with the
            full range of skills neccassary to be a Full-Stack Developer,
            although I must say Back-End encapsulates my true passion. I enjoy
            the creativity of Front-End but that joy is nothing compared to the
            calling I feel when figuring out the puzzle-like logic required to
            make a program run. I am currently a Tire Salesman & Technician at a
            business owned and operated by my family. Ultimately I am hoping to
            be able to get a career in coding so that I can build a bigger and
            better life for myself and my wife, and also apply my coding skills
            to our family business on the side so I can bring it into the modern
            world.</p>
